# Two Pointer Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains various **Two Pointer algorithms** implemented in Python, covering a range of problems that optimize **searching, sorting, and sequence operations** using the **two-pointer technique**. These implementations are useful for **array and string manipulations**, providing efficient solutions with reduced time complexity.

## Contents
- `MoveZeroes.py` – Move all zeros to the end of an array while maintaining relative order.
- `IsSubsequence.py` – Check if one string is a subsequence of another.
