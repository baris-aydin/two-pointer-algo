# Two Pointer Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains various **Two Pointer algorithms** implemented in Python, covering a range of problems that optimize **searching, sorting, and sequence operations** using the **two-pointer technique**. These implementations are useful for **array and string manipulations**, providing efficient solutions with reduced time complexity.

## Contents
- **Move Zeroes**: Reorder an array such that all zeroes are moved to the end while keeping non-zero elements in their original sequence.
- **IsSubsequence.py** â€“ Determines whether all characters of one string appear in another in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.
